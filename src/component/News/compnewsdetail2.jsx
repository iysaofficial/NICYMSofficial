                                Natural Sciences (F-MIPA), and the Faculty of Economics and Business (FEB) Universitas Brawijaya (UB)
                                won the Silver Medal in the field of Mechanical And Electrical Engineering at the 2022 International
                                Invention Competition for Young Moslem Scientist. (IICYMS 2022) which will be held on May 29 – June 14,
                                2022.Organized by the Indonesian Young Scientists Association (IYSA) in collaboration with Gunung Jati State
                                Islamic University (UIN) Bandung, IICYMS 2022 was attended by 114 participants from 9 countries such as
                                Thailand, Malaysia, India, Iran, Turkey, Macedonia, Brazil, United Arab Emirates , and Indonesia.

                                The UB team consists of Fitri Ayu Asyari (FT), Narista Rahma Fadila (FT), Adelia Raihana Nabilah
                                Firdausi (F-MIPA), Noor Adi Sukma (FEB), Gilang Hans Arthana (FEB) with supervisor Astuteryanti Tri
                                Lustyana, ST. , MT.In the final round they presented the work “The Concept of Future Vehicle with The Use of Lithium Metals
                                from Lapindo Sidoarjo”.“We present a vehicle concept design that is more environmentally friendly. The LIDO electric motor or
                                the abbreviation of the Lapindo mud electric motor,” said team member Fitri Ayu.

                                The student from the Department of Industrial Engineering added that the LIDO electric motor is a motor
                                that utilizes a battery from Lapindo Mud Rare Earth Metal (LTJ), namely lithium which is needed for the
                                development of an electric motor and a Bruslesh Direct Current (BLDC) dynamo to transmit electrical
                                energy to the battery as a substitute for fuel.“By utilizing LTJ as a battery, of course, it will be able to help utilize the Lapindo mud which was
                                only moved to become more useful. Where after being studied there is a high content of LTJ in the form
                                of lithium,” added the student from Jombang.Then the LIDO electric motor also uses a BLDC dynamo to help supply energy needs when the engine is
                                running. In the future, electric vehicles will lead to the concept of vehicles that are energy efficient
                                and environmentally friendly.“During this competition, we are very excited because this is our first international competition,” said
                                Fitri’s related to the experience of competing.Fitri admitted that the team also saw many cool ideas from other participants, but that did not
                                discourage them because they had prepared the best ideas from the team.“During the presentation, we also received feedback and insight from the judges regarding ideas related
                                to future development. Overall we are very happy because we managed to get a silver medal and get an
                                unforgettable experience,“ she concluded.
