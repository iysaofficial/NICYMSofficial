                            (FISIP), won international achievement yet again.
                            The students from various departments and batches
                            bagged the silver medal in the social life category
                            at International Invention Competition For Young
                            Moslem Scientists (IICYMS) 2022. The competition was
                            held in May 21 to June 14, 2022 in UIN Sunan Gunung
                            Djati Bandung West Java. In the interview with UNAIR
                            NEWS, Sulthan Fathi Nur Alauddin, the team leader,
                            said that they came up with the idea of Nuqof: Halal
                            Water Treatment Device With Ocimum Sanctum L Based
                            on Crowdfunding Wakaf as an Effort to Empowering
                            Drought-Affected Community to Support SDGs 2030.
                            “Waqf, which has not been optimized well in
                            Indonesia, is the background of Nuqof to develop a
                            drinking water treatment plant which, Insya Allah
                            [God willing], will be waqf-based,” he said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The idea was to provide clean water for people in
                            need through waqf system. A filtration concept,
                            combining ceramic, basil, and Natural Zeolite Stone
                            Water filtrations will be implemented in the Nuqof
                            system. “Therefore, the waqf culture in Indonesia is
                            not only intended for mosques and Islamic boarding
                            schools, but also for other humanitarian matters,
                            such as providing clean water,” he said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sulthan hoped that Nuqof will be able to solve the
                            clean water problems and provide water supplies in
                            drought areas in Indonesia to minimize the clean and
                            potable water scarcity. “Hopefully, there will be no
                            more drought in Indonesia, especially in areas whose
                            water unsuitable to drink, consume and use,” he
                            said. Author: Ananda Wildhan Wahyu Pratama Editor:
